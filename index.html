<h1>The Allegro Common Lisp Open Source Center</h1>

<h2>General Information and Statement of Purpose</h2>

<p>
Open Source licensing has for some time been a way to involve a
community of developers in the actual evolution of particular pieces
of code.
Franz Inc. has decided to publish select bodies of
Franz-developed code under an Open Source license.
</p>

<p>
We believe this will help teach Common Lisp programmers to write better
applications, demonstrate the uses
of Common Lisp to non-Common Lisp programmers, 
and give something to the community that has supported us over the years.
</p>

<h2>Open Source Projects</h2>

<p>
A list of projects can be found on our
<a href="https://github.com/franzinc">GitHub page</a>.
</p>

<h2>License Terms</h2>

<p>
Many popular open source licenses do not take into consideration
the special features of dynamic languages -- especially Lisp.
In an effort to remedy this, we have created a new license called the
<a href="preamble.html">LLGPL</a>,
the <a href="preamble.html">Lisp Lesser GNU Public
License</a>.  The <a href="preamble.html">LLGPL</a> consists of
a preamble, developed specifically for Lisp applications, and the
<a href="license.html">LGPL</a>.  Please note that when these
two conflict, the preamble takes precedence.
</p>
<p>
We use the <a href="preamble.html">LLGPL</a> for
most of our open source projects, and you can too.  Feel free
to incorporate the <a href="preamble.html">LLGPL</a> into any
of your open source Lisp applications.
We recommend putting the contents of
<a href="template/header.txt">template/header.txt</a>, or something
similar, at the beginning of your source files.  We also
recommend putting the file
<a href="template/license.txt">template/license.txt</a>
somewhere in the root directory of your distribution.
</p>

<h2>Support/How to submit code</h2>

<p>
There is an informal community support and development 
<a href="mailinglist.html">mailing list</a>
<i>(concatenate 'simple-string "opensource" "@" "franz.com")</i>
for these open source projects.
We encourage you to take advantage by subscribing to the list.
Once you're subscribed, send email with your questions, comments, and
suggestions.
Changes to the code are best done via forking and pull requests.
</p>
