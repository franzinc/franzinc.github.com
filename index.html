      <div class="section">General Information and Statement of Purpose</div>
      
      <p>
	Open Source licensing has for some time been a way to involve a
	community of developers in the actual evolution of particular pieces
	of code.  Franz Inc. has decided to publish select bodies of
	Franz-developed code under an Open Source license.
      </p>

      <p>
	We believe this will help teach Common Lisp programmers to write better
	applications, demonstrate the uses
	of Common Lisp to non-Common Lisp programmers, 
	and give something to the community that has supported us over the years.
      </p>

      <div class="section">Open Source Projects</div>

      Franz Inc.'s open source projects are hosted on
      <a href="http://github.com/franzinc">
	github.com
      </a>.
      
      <div class="subsection">Open Source Project Documentation</div>

      Most of our projects have a README.md file included that gives a good description 
      of how to get things up and running.  For allegroserve, which has more indepth
      documentation we've setup an 
      <a href="http://opensource.franz.com/aserve">AllegroServe online documentation area</a> 
      to better display the documentation that is distributed with the software.

      <div class="section">License Terms</div>
      
      <p>
	The popular open source licenses do not take into consideration
	the special features of dynamic languages -- especially Lisp.  
	In an effort to remedy this, we have created a new license called the
	<a href="preamble.html"> LLGPL</a>, the 
	<a href="preamble.html">Lisp Lesser GNU Public License</a>. The 
	<a href="preamble.html"> LLGPL</a> consists of a preamble,
	developed specifically for Lisp applications, and the
	<a href="license.html">LGPL</a>.  Please note that when these
	two conflict, the preamble takes precedence.
      </p>

      <p>
	Franz Inc. will use the <a href="preamble.html"> LLGPL</a> with all of
	its open source products, and you can too.  Feel free to incorporate
	the <a href="preamble.html"> LLGPL</a> into any of your open source
	Lisp applications.  We recommend putting the contents of 
	<a href="template/header.txt">template/header.txt</a>, or something
	similar, at the beginning of your source files.  We also
	recommend putting the file 
	<a href="template/license.txt">template/license.txt</a>
	somewhere in the root directory of your distribution.
      </p>

      <div class="section">Support/How to submit code</div>

      <p>
	There is an informal community support and development 
	<a href="mailinglist.html">mailing list</a>
	(opensource@franz.com) for these open source projects.  We
	encourage you to take advantage by subscribing to the list.
	Once you're subscribed, send email
	to <b>opensource@franz.com</b> with your questions, comments,
	suggestions, and patches.</p>
